TestDrawMaze properly creates a Maze Object, and has correct height, width etc for all MazeObjects
However while drawing a 10x10 square by individual pixels works,
the drawObject method in DrawMaze Class doesn't draw anything.

Whatever error is also encountered when trying to draw on lcd screen using GraphicLCD class (which think does work - use fillRec method)
So see if can figure out why.

Also implement a method that given a MazeObject will draw it onto the lcd screen
- probably requires making a metric coordinate system
