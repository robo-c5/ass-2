Maze make some methods static

T - might be good idea to detect when you've crossed double black, and then travel half tile, then it won't get out of synch?
T - couple of behaviours causing errors with null pointers, will debug next time
T - think need to add git ignore to RunMazeSolver.jar but too scared
T - close sensors in end arby
T - make sure tiles are marked as visited when the robot has stepped on the tile, and also add this tile to the navpath at same time
T - metric pos not beeing set in maze object

J - maybe remove redundant classes like coordinate and use lejos ones instead?
Calibrate wheelbase - have it draw squares, then if turns too much decrease wheelbase, if too little increase (by about 5% a time)
See how NavMesh works with different size 


Issue in Maze - when looking for tiles adjacent to a given tile, returned tile is one too far over- e.g. getNearestTile returns (65, 25) instead of (45, 25), when given (25, 25)
not sure if this is because getNearestTile has two .getAdjacent() calls on one object? Anyway calling it a day here
