Maze make some methods static

T- Get robot moving and detecting walls using behaviours
T- might be good idea to detect when you've crossed double black, and then travel half tile, then it won't get out of synch?
T - couple of behaviours causing errors with null pointers, will debug next time
T - think need to add git ignore to RunMazeSolver.jar but too scared
T - replace EV3 references with MazeSolvingRobot references


J - maybe remove redundant classes like coordinate and use lejos ones instead?
J - discuss behavior design - possibly remove DetectWall?
