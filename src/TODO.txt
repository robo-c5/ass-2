Maze make some methods static

T - might be good idea to detect when you've crossed double black, and then travel half tile, then it won't get out of synch?
T - couple of behaviours causing errors with null pointers, will debug next time
T - make sure tiles are marked as visited when the robot has stepped on the tile, and also add this tile to the navpath at same time

Calibrate Wheelbase - have it draw squares, then if turns too much decrease wheelbase, if too little increase (by about 5% a time)

Issue in Maze - when looking for tiles adjacent to a given tile, returned tile is one too far over- e.g. getNearestTile returns (65, 25) instead of (45, 25), when given (25, 25)
not sure if this is because getNearestTile has two .getAdjacent() calls on one object? Anyway calling it a day here

discuss the above tomorrow - remember to use TestMaze to check anything relating to intialisation of Maze
setup EV3-PC communication so can debug
may be able to go back to turning 90 degrees if calibrate wheelbase properly
may be able to get rid of boundary walls entirely and just use a rectangle as a bounding rectangle (many leJOS classes use this). Then 0,0 would be the starting Tile which would be nice.

perhaps add a Visitable flag to Tiles so that don't have to check every tile in case where Tile is entirely enclosed by walls.

A star search we make don't use lejos
