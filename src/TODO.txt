Maze make some methods static

T - might be good idea to detect when you've crossed double black, and then travel half tile, then it won't get out of synch?
T - couple of behaviours causing errors with null pointers, will debug next time
T - think need to add git ignore to RunMazeSolver.jar but too scared
T - close sensors in end arby
T - make sure tiles are marked as visited when the robot has stepped on the tile, and also add this tile to the navpath at same time

J - maybe remove redundant classes like coordinate and use lejos ones instead?
J - discuss behavior design - possibly remove DetectWall?
